Creation, Retrieval and Removal of data on the server-side must be developed in Node.js and through the use of appropriate modules.
Clean, intuitive and responsive user interface (Bootstrap or similar) and appropriate visual representation of the data on the client-side (CSS, JavaScript/JS-based frameworks).
Security measures, such as validation of user input on the client-side (JavaScript/JS-based frameworks) and sanitisation of user input on the server-side (Node.js) through the use of appropriate modules.
